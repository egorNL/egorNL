## Hi there :wave: Egor is here!

### :smile: Pronounced like that, btw: 
> A slavic name (Ð•Ð³Ð¾Ñ€) that is the same as Yegor, but differs from Igor. Egor is properly pronounced Yegor, with the stress on the 2nd syllable and the r rrrrolled. It has a Norse origin meaning "archer-soldier." It is relatively uncommon, even in Russia.

### Are you still alive? Then let's move on!

<p style="text-align: justify;">:point_right: I'm a young and ambitious guy with legal education and a broad outlook. Who is not afraid of difficulties and tries something completely new, because all life is study! Now I am happy to try my hands in the IT world :star_struck:</p>
&nbsp;
<p>And it's great to get a big dose of serotonin and endorphins when you successfully solve problems while working on your next IT project.</p>

> So in this case, my motto is: "Always go ahead and make new neural connections".
